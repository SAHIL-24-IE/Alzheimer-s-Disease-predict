# Alzheimer-s-Disease-predict
 Disease prediction
The primary goal of this project was to apply and compare several machine learning classification algorithms to predict the presence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) based on patient health information. The project aimed to identify the most effective model for predicting AD status, potentially aiding in early detection and intervention.
